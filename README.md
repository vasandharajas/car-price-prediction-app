Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction

Objective:
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of used cars based on multiple features such as the make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and more. This model will be integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit application to enable both customers and sales representatives to predict car prices instantly by inputting car details into the app.

Project Scope:
Data: Historical data on used car prices collected from CarDekho, containing a variety of features that can affect a car's price, such as make, model, year, fuel type, city, transmission type, etc.
User Interaction: The final product will be an interactive web application where users can input car attributes and receive a predicted price in real-time.
The project will cover the entire pipeline from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment of the application.

Approach:
1. Data Processing
Data Import and Concatenation:
Import multiple datasets, possibly unstructured (e.g., CSV files from different cities), and concatenate them into a single structured dataset. A new "City" column will be added to maintain the source of the data.

Handling Missing Values:
Identify missing values and use imputation strategies based on the column type (e.g., mean/median for numerical columns, mode for categorical columns).

Standardizing Data Formats:
Ensure all data is in a consistent format. For example, if some features like car mileage are stored as strings with units (e.g., "70 kms"), strip the units and convert the values to numerical format.

Encoding Categorical Variables:
Convert categorical features like fuel type, transmission type, and make/model into numerical formats using:

One-Hot Encoding for nominal categories.
Label Encoding for ordinal categories (e.g., transmission types: automatic, manual).
Normalizing Numerical Features:
Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity and to help certain algorithms like KNN or Gradient Boosting. Techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling will be used.

Outlier Detection and Removal:
Identify and handle outliers using methods like the IQR (Interquartile Range) or Z-score to ensure the model isn’t skewed by extreme values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:
Calculate basic statistics to understand the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, range) of the features.

Data Visualization:
Use visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to identify correlations and patterns in the dataset.

Feature Selection:
Perform feature importance analysis to determine the most impactful variables. Correlation matrices will help identify relationships between features and target variables (car price).

3. Model Development
Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, usually in a 70-30 or 80-20 ratio, to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen data.

Model Selection:
Try a variety of machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, such as:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
XGBoost
Model Training:
Train models on the training dataset, using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness and reduce overfitting.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Use Grid Search or Random Search to optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen models for better performance.

4. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics:
Evaluate the models using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²)
Model Comparison:
Compare the performance of different models and select the one that provides the best balance of accuracy and generalization.
5. Optimization
Feature Engineering:
Based on insights from EDA, create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

Regularization:
Apply regularization techniques (e.g., Lasso and Ridge) to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

6. Deployment
Streamlit Application Development:
Deploy the final, optimized model using Streamlit, creating an interactive web application that allows users to input car details and get an instant price prediction.

User Interface Design:
The UI will be designed to be intuitive and simple, with clear instructions for input fields and error handling for invalid inputs.

Model Integration:
The trained model will be integrated into the Streamlit application, allowing real-time predictions when users input car details.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
Pandas (data manipulation)
NumPy (numerical operations)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
Scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms and evaluation)
XGBoost (advanced model)
Streamlit (app development)
Pickle/Joblib (model serialization)
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
Deployment: Streamlit (for the web app)

Conclusion:
This project aims to leverage machine learning to provide an accurate, real-time car price prediction system for both customers and sales representatives in the automotive industry. The process includes data cleaning, EDA, model selection, optimization, and deployment of a user-friendly web application, all aimed at streamlining the pricing process and enhancing customer satisfaction.
